# Custom Procedure

> This amazing feature is implemented by [Mike Willbanks
](https://github.com/mwillbanks).

> **Preview Feature**

Custom procedure is in preview and may be subject to breaking changes in future releases.

> **Available since v3.2.0**

> **🔋 ZModel vs Prisma Schema**

Custom procedure is a ZModel feature and doesn't exist in PSL.

Custom procedures are like database stored procedures that allow you to define reusable routines encapsulating complex logic.

Use the `procedure` keyword to define a custom procedure in ZModel. Here's an example for a query procedure:

```zmodel title="schema.zmodel"
procedure getUserFeeds(userId: Int, limit: Int?) : Post[]
```

Mutation procedures (that write to the database) should be defined with `mutation procedure`:

```zmodel title="schema.zmodel"
mutation procedure signUp(email: String) : User
```

You can use all types supported by ZModel to define procedure parameters and return types, including:

  - Primitive types like `Int`, `String`
  - Models
  - Enums
  - Custom types
  - Array of the types above

Parameter types can be marked optional with a `?` suffix. If a procedure doesn't return anything, use `Void` as the return type.

Custom procedures are implemented with TypeScript when constructing the ORM client, and can be invoked via the ORM client in backend code. See [Custom Procedures](../orm/custom-proc.md) in the ORM part for more details.

They are also accessible via Query-as-a-Service (via [RPC-style](../service/api-handler/rpc.md#endpoints) or [RESTful-style](../service/api-handler/rest.md#calling-custom-procedures) API), plus consumable via Client SDKs like [TanStack Query Client](../service/client-sdk/tanstack-query/#custom-procedures).
